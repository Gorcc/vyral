Vyral is an award-winning, full-stack video-sharing application developed as a final graduation project. It functions like YouTube but with a unique mission: to level the playing field for small creators. The platform's core algorithm is designed to identify and promote quality content from new and undiscovered channels, helping them gain traction and find their audience.

## üåü Mission & Concept

In a world dominated by established influencers, new creators often struggle to get their content seen. Vyral was built to solve this problem. Instead of prioritizing already popular channels, our system actively pushes videos from smaller creators to the forefront, giving them a fair chance to get more views and grow their community. This project is a proof-of-concept for a more equitable video-sharing ecosystem.
